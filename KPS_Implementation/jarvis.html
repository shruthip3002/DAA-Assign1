        <h1>Jarvis March Algorithm</h1>
        <p>Here you will find information about Jarvis March algorithm.</p>
        <p>The time complexity of Jarvis March algorithm depends on the number of points \( n \) and the number of points on the convex hull \( h \).</p>
        <p>The outer loop iterates through each point to find the leftmost point, which takes \( O(n) \) time.</p>
        <p>For each point on the convex hull, finding the next point with the maximum angle takes \( O(n) \) time.</p>
        <p>In the worst case, each point is part of the convex hull. Therefore, the total time complexity is \( O(nh) \).</p>
        <p>In the worst case scenario, when the number of points on the convex hull is \( h = n \), the time complexity becomes \( O(n^2) \). However, in typical scenarios, the convex hull usually has fewer points than the total number of points, leading to an average-case complexity of \( O(nh) \), which can be much better than \( O(n^2) \).</p>
