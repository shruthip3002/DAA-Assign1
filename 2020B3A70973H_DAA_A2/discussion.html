        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The RNA folding algorithm serves to anticipate the secondary structure of an RNA sequence, a crucial task in understanding its function. This structure delineates how individual bases, or nucleotides, within the RNA sequence pair with one another, forming stable configurations such as hairpin loops, internal loops, and bulges.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="container green">
        <h2>Algorithm Overview</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Initialization:</strong>  Begin by creating an empty matrix called OPT, which has dimensions n x n, where 'n' signifies the length of the RNA sequence.</li>
            <li><strong>Base Cases:</strong> Set the diagonal elements of OPT to 0, indicating instances where subsequences of length 1 lack paired bases.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Programming:</strong> Progress through all conceivable subproblems, starting from shorter subsequences and gradually advancing to longer ones.</li>
            <li><strong>Recurrence Relation:</strong> For each subsequence of length 'k', explore all potential split points to determine the most optimal pairing. Update the value in OPT[i][j] based on the maximum number of base pairs formed through various pairing possibilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Backtracking:</strong> Once the entire sequence has been processed and the OPT matrix populated, trace back through the matrix to reconstruct the optimal secondary structure. This involves moving from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner, identifying the paired bases along the way.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="container green">
        <h2>Visualization Explanation</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>In terms of visualization, the algorithm represents the RNA's secondary structure as a string of base pairs enclosed within parentheses, like "(())". Throughout computation, each cell in the OPT matrix corresponds to a specific subsequence of the RNA sequence. The value contained within each cell signifies the maximum number of base pairs formed within that particular subsequence.

                By retracing the steps through the OPT matrix, from its starting point to its endpoint, the algorithm effectively delineates the optimal secondary structure and identifies the paired bases, offering invaluable insights into the RNA's functional properties.</li>
